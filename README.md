# ChatCo

**ChatCo is a simple chat plugin which has the following features:**

- Players can customize their chat message using various prefixes. As an example putting an '>' before a chat message
  will turn the text green (green-text). (Note: Does not change the color of player names).
- Players can whisper other players (defaults to a purple color).
- Players can ignore another player (works for both world and whisper chat). Ignore lists are persistent between logins.
  Players can also un-ignore a previously ignored player.
- Allows for a customizable spoiler text system (who wants to ruin the walking dead for everyone?).
- Players can toggle chat on/off.
- Full permission support so that you can limit who has access to what colors / features.
- Allows the administrator to log whispers between players. (Could be against EU law.)
